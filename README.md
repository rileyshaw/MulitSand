# MultiSand
MultiSand takes the best components of your childhood online sand game, and makes it available for you and your friends to enjoy together! MultiSand was a final project for CS252. Our goal was to allow user's to create their own room's for their friends to join and play around with sand all in realtime. 

MultiSand is written in Node.js, using the Socket.io technology to seperate and stream data to each user's connected. Along with this the chat functionality is saved room to room using a Redis database.
